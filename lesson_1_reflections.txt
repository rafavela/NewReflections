How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced? Because it shows me all
the changes I have made since the last time I completed the code, so it will show all the possible bugs that were 
introduced to the code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term? By 
having a faster access to code that doesn't have the bugs introduced to the new version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pro the commits will be per logical change
Pro The history will not be cluttered
Cons it takes time to choose when to commit
Cons if it is forgotten much work could be lost

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because git is for code.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log to view the commits and notes on the commits
git diff to view the differences between commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something? A lot.
